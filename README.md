# GCN-Projects

### Why graphs?

1. In image we have up, down, left and right tesors and in text we have left and right words, however in graphs there is no direction.

2. Neural networks : input(graphs), output(classification, prediction and ... )

3. Feature engineering is eliminated instead we have Representation learning which automatically learn the features.

4. Map nodes to d-dimenstional embeddings, similar nodes are embedded close together.

### Applications of Graph ML

1. Node classifciation 

2. Link prediction 

3. Graph classification

4. Clustering

5. Graph generation 

6. Graph evolution
